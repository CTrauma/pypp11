# Py++11 - [pybind11] code generator

Py++11, successor of Py++, is a code generator for [pybind11] that simplifies
writing Python bindings of a C/C++ library. The tool is implemented as a Python
module and is controlled by a user script.

Check out the [pybind11 documentation][pybind11doc] for more information on 
[pybind11]!

## Contribution

This repository currently hosts the original Py++ code, exposing C/C++
libraries as Boost.Python code. This should change in future, so we will make
it a community effort to port Py++ to pybind11, making it Py++11.

Please feel free to help reaching the goal and create an awesome code generator
for an awesome library! :grin:
